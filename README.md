# Financial_Models

### This is a repository for financial programs and functions that I write in Python. 

Conversion_Arbitrage is a program that scrapes stock and option data and finds conversion arbitrage opportunities. 

Options_Strategies_Graphing is a function that graphs returns of long/short equity, calls, and puts at the options' expiry date depending on the stock price.
