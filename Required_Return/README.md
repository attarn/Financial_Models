# Weights_Reqret

This program reads in the daily returns of assets from a speadsheet and finds either the optimal weighting of each asset to produce the absolute minimum risk or the minimum risk given a required level of returns. 

Assets should be in this format
```
Asset 1	Asset 2	Asset 3
0.467	0.478	-0.13
0.126	0.297	0.47
0.246	-0.734	0.56
0.279	0.215	0.94
0.316	0.996	0.77
-0.482	-0.370	0.75
-0.232	-0.370	0.82
